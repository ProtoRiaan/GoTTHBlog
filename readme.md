### Welcome to my GoTTHBlog project.

This project aims to be fork on my current flaskJinjaBlog project. Hopfelly I can pull from the same squelite database and dont yet have to transition to postgress.
This is going to be my first real Go project. 

GoTTH = Go Templ Tailwinds and HTMX. I will also be using Echo for the route handeling. 


Wish me luck folks.
